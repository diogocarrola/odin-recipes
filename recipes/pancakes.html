    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These buckwheat pancakes came about for a few reasons: I get lots of requests for anything breakfast, I'm trying to cook
      with more whole grains, and I heard someone say it's almost impossible to make a great pancake using 100% buckwheat flour.
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup buckwheat flour</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons white sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 1/4 cups buttermilk</li>
      <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk buckwheat flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a medium bowl.</li>
        <li>Beat buttermilk, egg, and vanilla together in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Pour flour mixture into buttermilk mixture; whisk until batter is thick and smooth. Let batter rest until bubbles form and batter relaxes, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Melt butter on a griddle over medium heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the hot griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges dry, 3 to 4 minutes.
          Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
        <li>Serve with berries.</li>
    </ol>
